# Home Assistant Alfred

A workflow to control some aspects of your Home Assistant.

## Currently supported:

- automations
- switches

## Requirements

- Currently it needs a php installation, maybe I'll re-implement it with something that MacOS ships by default, in the meantime you need to install PHP via homebrew
